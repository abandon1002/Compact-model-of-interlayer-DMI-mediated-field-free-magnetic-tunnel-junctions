DMI-SOT-MTJ is a compact interlayer DMI-mediated field-free Spin-Orbit Torque Magnetic Tunnel Junction (SOT-MTJ) model. By abandoning the traditional perpendicular free layer structure, it adopts a composite stacked structure consisting of an in-plane free layer, a coupling layer and an out-of-plane free layer, and combines with the interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) to accurately predict the magnetization dynamics of the device. The model has completed macrospin simulations based on the MATLAB platform and been validated for effectiveness via the micromagnetic simulation tool MUMAX3.

Fully implemented in Verilog-A, this model not only enables rapid device parameter optimization, but also provides design and simulation support for large-scale circuits and systems of field-free MRAMs with different substrates and magnetic materials. It significantly improves the speed at which the device’s magnetic moment returns to a stable state after the removal of external voltage and current, offering critical technical support for the research and development of high-speed field-free MRAMs.
